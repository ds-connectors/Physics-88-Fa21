    "Read the description `wind.desc` to understand the format of `wind.data`. Then, write a program which loads the data and generates a new array with the following format: each row should contain the year, month, mean wind speed, min wind speed, and max wind speed, in that order. The means, mins, and maxes should be taken over all days in that particular month, over all the cities that `wind.data` includes. The rows should be in chronological order. Printing your array should give you something like this:\n",

(Hint: What happens when you plot a 2D array?) Be sure to label your figure with proper units, etc. The x-axis may be labeled using year/month or just the years (i.e. have ticks along the axis which are labeled with some of the years, like 1961,1964,1967,1970,etc.). There are several ways to accomplish this. One way is to use `plt.xticks()`, which will give you the most explicit control over which points on the x axis get labeled and what labels they get. To understand this function, check out the documentation for `matplotlib.pyplot.xticks` on the `matplotlib` website.\n",

To better see the period, use the `running_average` function you wrote for the Sunspots problem to plot the running average of the means, mins, and maxes along with the original curves. Depending on how you wrote your `running_average` function, it may work immediately on this new 2D array without any modifications! From visual inspection of your running average, how long is the period, and when are wind speeds fastest and slowest in Ireland?\n",
